The following codes are for communication between the Microsoft HoloLens-2 and Laptop with both TCP and UDP protocols. The purpose of these codes is to enable the communication between the Augmented Reality headset (HoloLens-2) and Laptop. 

You have to use Unity Engine to associate the C-sharp code to build it for Universal Windows Platform (UWP) that can later be deployed in HoloLens-2 via Visual Studio.    

My purpose to use these codes is to evaluate the performance of HoloLens-2 in terms of data rate. In another words, I wanted to know how much data HoloLens-2 can send and receive per unit time. 



There are 6 codes in this file.

The first two are TCP client and server for Laptop and HoloLens.

- The first code is named as TCP_Client (Python script) which runs on the Laptop as a client.

- The second code is named as TCP_Server (C# script) which is run on HoloLens after developing in Unity Engine as a project.



The next two are UDP client and server for laptop and HoloLens, where Hololens is a server and Laptop is a client.

And the Last two are UDP client and server for laptop and HoloLens, where Hololens is a client and Laptop is a server.
